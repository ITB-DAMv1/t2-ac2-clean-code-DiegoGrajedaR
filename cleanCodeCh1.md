
# *CHAPTER ONE: CLEAN CODE*

#### This book will talk about programming and different topics about this area. Also will see the differences about a bad code with respect to a good code and how we can write a good code.

## There will be code
#### The code will not disappear because it represents the precise detail. If you have to create a program to solve a very specific problem you will create a code that takes into account all these specifications and not an AI that creates a program to solve a problem in a more abstract way.

## Bad code & The Total Cost of Owning a Mess
#### In the book Implementation Patterns by Kent Beck the author says that writing correct code is important to success in software development. It is important to correct bad code early on because otherwise the productivity is lost and it becomes difficult to make future changes.

## Attitude & The Primal Conundrum
#### Programmers must act as true professionals, taking responsibility for code quality and not producing incorrect code just to meet deadlines. The true professional understands that this approach is not viable in the long run.

## The Art of Clean Code? What Is Clean Code?
#### Creating clean code requires discipline, time and knowing what is right. A true programmer identifies bad code and transforms it into good code.

#### Clean code is defined in different ways by programming experts:

- Bjarne Stroustrup, clean code should be “elegant and efficient”, with clear logic and minimal dependencies.

- Grady Booch adds that it should read like “well-written text” and clearly state design intentions.

- “Big” Dave Thomas highlights the importance of code that is easy to improve and test, using correct names.

- Michael Feathers stresses that clean code looks like it was written by someone who really cares.

- Ron Jeffries stresses avoiding duplication and maximizing expressiveness.

- Ward Cunningham defines clean code as code that meets the reader's expectations.

## Schools of Thought
#### Uncle Bob considers his idea to clean code to be a “school of thought”. There is not one definitive idea about clean code but many and it is important that the programmer continues to explore these.


## We Are Authors & The Boy Scout Rule
#### Uncle Bob says that programmers should write code that is easy for their readers to read and also well organized.

#### To achieve this Bob suggests following the “Boy Scout rule”. This rule involves making small improvements, such as changing variable names or simplifying functions for constant improvement.
