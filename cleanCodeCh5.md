## Importance of Formatting

#### Code formatting is not just for aesthetics; it is a tool that improves readability and makes it easier to maintain. Well-structured code reflects professionalism and makes it easier to understand later.

## Code Size and Structure

- *Vertical Formatting:* Files between 200 and 500 lines are usually more understandable.

- *Newspaper Metaphor:* Structure code from general to specific; main functions should go first, followed by helper functions.

- *Visual Separation:* Use blank lines to divide concepts and group related lines of code.

- *Vertical Proximity:* Keep related lines of code together to avoid unnecessary scrolling through the file.

## Variable Declarations

#### Declare variables as close to their first use as possible to improve clarity.

## Instance Variable Placement

#### Place instance variables at the beginning of the class, allowing them to be easily located.

## Function Organization

#### Order functions so that dependent ones appear lower down, facilitating logical flow.

## Conceptual Affinity

#### Groups functions or elements with similar purposes.

## Horizontal Formatting

- Line Width: Lines up to 120 characters are comfortable to read on modern displays.

- Horizontal Spacing: Use white space to visually separate assignments and improve clarity in math expressions and function calls.

## Indentation and Hierarchy

#### Indentation reflects the structure of the code, making it easier to read and understand its internal organization.

## Uncle Bob's Rules

#### Applying principles such as descriptive names, separation of duties, and hierarchical structure with consistent indentation reinforces clarity and professionalism in code.
